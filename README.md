# Tic_Tac_Toe_AI
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe AI Game!This project is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally against the human player. The game is built using Python and Pygame, providing an intuitive graphical interface for users to interact with. The project is divided into two main parts: the AI_TicTac.py, which contains the game logic, and the Game_interface.py, which handles the user interface and interactions.
**Features**
*Human vs AI Gameplay*: Play against an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
*Graphical Interface*: User-friendly graphical interface built with Pygame.
*Game Status Indication*: Clearly indicates when the game is won, lost, or tied.
*Restart and Quit Options*: Option to restart the game or quit after a match ends.
*Visual Winning Line*: Draws a line across the winning combination when a player wins.
